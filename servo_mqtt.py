# GPIO Setup
#   GPIOPin - Pin on the raspberry pi that is controlling the servo
#   PulseFrequency- Frequency of the pulses sent to the servo
#                   The servo expects a pulse every 20ms for between 1ms and 2ms
#                   1ms corresponds to an angle of 0 degrees, while a pulse of 2ms
#                   corresponds to an angle of 180 degrees
#                   - A value of 100(Hz) means that the Pi will send a pulse 100 times per 
#                   second, or once every 10ms.
#
#   PWM0 - The percentage of time that GPIO pin must be "ON" so that 
#           the motor will turn to angle 0
#           The equation for finding the Correct PWM0, or the pulse modulation 
#                     Required to set the servo to angle 0 is:
#                         DutyCycle = PW/T * 100%
#                         D=1ms/20ms*100 = 5
#           For the motor that I am using (FS5106B), the angles are a bit funky, and 
#           I had to increase the Duty Cycle to 6.5

# Part 4: CMD/CTRL - Helps separate different types of messages for code clarity
